Instructions for the game of Nim:
To play a game, simply run the program and it will begin.
To start, choose a number of dots to play the game with.
The program will then prompt you to select how far apart the dots are,
this is merely for the visual effect.
As a simple hint, select 5 pixels. If you make a selection that would make a display too large to fit on screen,
the program will prompt you to select a smaller value.
Once these values have been input, the screen will print based on your values.
You will have to click back and forth between the printed screen and the command window for game play.
Once the game begins, you and the computer will take turns removing a number of dots between 1 and 4.
After each selection, the display will update and show the new remaining number of dots.
The player (or computer) who takes the last dot wins!
Good Luck!
